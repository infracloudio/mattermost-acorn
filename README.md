# Acorn for Mattermost

[Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/) is an open source platform for secure collaboration across the entire software development lifecycle. It is a software that allows real-time communication, project management and task organization in an easy and accessible way. 

The Acornfile uses the Mattermost Enterprise Edition v7.8 which runs in Preview Mode by default unless Mattermost License is added. Once deployed Mattermost, the users can sign in or login and add team members to start collaborating with their team.
